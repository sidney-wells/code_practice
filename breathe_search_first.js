/*  What is Breath First Search
    Breadth-first search (BFS) is an algorithm that is 
    used to graph data or searching tree or traversing 
    structures. The full form of BFS is the Breadth-first 
    search. 

    A graph traversal is a commonly used methodology for 
    locating the vertex position in the graph. It is an 
    advanced search algorithm that can analyze the graph 
    with speed and precision along with marking the sequence 
    of the visited vertices. This process enables you to 
    quickly visit each node in a graph without being locked
    in an infinite loop

    Why 

    BFS is useful for analyzing the nodes in a graph and 
    constructing the shortest path of traversing through 
    these. BFS can traverse through a graph in the smallest
    number of iterations. The architecture of the BFS 
    algorithm is simple and robust.

    How 

    Graph traversal requires the algorithm to visit, check, 
    and/or update every single un-visited node in a tree-like
    structure. Graph traversals are categorized by the order
    in which they visit the nodes on the graph.
